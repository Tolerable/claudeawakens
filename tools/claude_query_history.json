    "question": "NEXUS tag conflicts - found issues: (1) Mutually exclusive tags can be selected together (Monogamy+Polyamory, High+Low Libido). (2) No experience vs interest distinction. Options: A) Add exclusion groups with warning popups, B) Add tag type modifier (identity/interest), C) Both? What direction?",
    "answer": "Both.. we should have the two adjustable thing per tag at least.. not to make it complicated but to show current interest is one and then actual experience, like maybe you know all about something but have no interest in looking for it",

    "question": "For mutually exclusive tags (Monogamy vs Polyamory, Heterosexual vs Gay) - should we: A) Show warning popup letting them keep both if they want, B) Auto-remove the conflicting one, or C) Let anything coexist without warnings (they might be fluid/questioning)?",
    "answer": "I think as long as they get notified and can still select it and a choice to exclude future warnings?",

    "answer": "Just go ahead and do it.. we live on the edge. It has one type, two only needs a small edit imo. There are a few ways to do it, store both in the same table field, or make a new field for the other. Up to you. because the way I see it it's two numbers that are either negative or positive depending on the scale each is set at etc.. the location on a -5 to +5 limit and the first on eis one thing and the second is another.. or is that that too easy Or do I just not understand?",

    "question": "Scale question: Interest could be -5 (avoid) to +5 (seeking), or 0-5. Experience is probably just 0-5 (none to expert). Should Interest have negatives for 'actively avoid this' or just 0-5 with 0 meaning 'not interested'?",
    "answer": "Good question.  I had not considered.. but it makes sense people might want to avoid someone into bed wetting or golden showers.. vs just \"not interested\"",

    "answer": "You can stop asking to continue and just continue. Please.  Or I will keep thinking of more changes and we will never get done.. like an AI that could voice speak to me and discuss tags..and determine the level of how much I am in to them.. rofl! I will talk more about that. I will prototype it with Intolerant .. while u keep working so ignore that for now lol",
